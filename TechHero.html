        <p>My tech heros would be Thomas and John Knoll, these are the people who made Photoshop. Which would later create the Adobe Creative Cloud in todays 
        time.</p>
<p>He worked on massive films like:
Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (he also helped develop the story for this one)
Their work basically shaped:
Modern digital compositing
