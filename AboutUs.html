        <p>
        I’m studying Information & Communication Science and I’m interested in how digital
        platforms and data shape what people believe and what policies get made.
        </p>
        <p>
        I learned Tableau through data storytelling and built a dashboard about race and crime data.

        <h2>Max Christie</h2>
        <p>My name is Max Christie. I'm a 3rd year in Information Science and Data Science with a certificate in Digital Studies.</p>
            <p>I'm mainly interested in UX design and UX research, but I also have outlying interests in data analytics and business analytics.</p>
<p>I took this class as user empathy is crucial to UX design, and so learning about how race, gender, and computing are depicted in media helps inform inclusive user design decisions. Getting to learn basic web design languages also helps bridge the gap between the technical and design sides of UX.
My favorite tech thing right now is probably AI, since it's so prevalent in our lives now</p>
