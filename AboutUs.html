<h1>About Me</h1>

</header>
<main>
<p>
Hi, I’m America. I’m studying Information & Communication Science and I’m interested in how digital
platforms and data shape what people believe and what policies get made.
</p>
<p>
I learned Tableau through data storytelling and built a dashboard about race and crime data—especially how
the same numbers can be interpreted differently depending on context and framing.
</p>
<p>
I care about clear communication, digital ethics, and making information understandable without
oversimplifying it.
